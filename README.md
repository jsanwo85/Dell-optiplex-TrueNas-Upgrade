# Upgrading and Repurposing a Dell OptiPlex 3020 into a Home NAS with TrueNAS SCALE

---

## Overview
In this hands-on home lab project, I repurposed a legacy Dell OptiPlex 3020 desktop into a fully functional Network Attached Storage (NAS) system. The project covered hardware upgrades, OS changes, and the installation/configuration of TrueNAS SCALE.

---

## Objectives
- Extend the life of an old PC.
- Build a cost-effective personal cloud solution.
- Practice NAS and SMB setup for home networking.
- Enable centralized file access from multiple devices.

---

## Hardware Upgrades
- **Base System**: Dell OptiPlex 3020
- **Before**:
  - 4GB DDR3 RAM
  - 500GB HDD
  - Windows 8.1
- **After**:
  - 8GB DDR3 RAM (added another 4GB stick)
  - 2TB SATA HDD
  - Bootable USB with TrueNAS SCALE
  - PCIe WiFi & Bluetooth card for wireless access

---

## Software Setup
- Upgraded to Windows 11 temporarily for validation
- Installed TrueNAS SCALE on USB stick via ISO image
- Created datasets (e.g., DocsShare, jsanwo, Media, Photo)
- Configured SMB for Windows and Android file access
- Set static IP for stability on local network
- Created user `jsanwo` with secure credentials and permissions

---

## Challenges
- Initial dataset permission issues (`ix-applications`)
- App Services could not deploy (Tailscale pending)
- UI access issues from mobile due to IP conflicts

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remote access (e.g., Tailscale) setup is still in progress. This will be a follow-up project.

## Outcome
- Transformed a basic PC into a powerful NAS
- Learned ZFS datasets, sharing protocols, and system upgrades
- All shares successfully accessed over LAN
- Future step: configure and secure remote access

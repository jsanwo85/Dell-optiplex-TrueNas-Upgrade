# Dell OptiPlex 3020 NAS Upgrade Project

## Overview
This project documents the upgrade and transformation of a Dell OptiPlex 3020 desktop PC into a TrueNAS SCALE-powered Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. The goal was to repurpose an old PC into a cost-effective, fully functioning personal cloud solution with centralized storage and sharing capabilities.

## Objectives
- Upgrade an outdated Dell PC with new hardware components.
- Install and configure TrueNAS SCALE for LAN-based storage access.
- Set up secure SMB shares for multi-device connectivity.
- Build foundational knowledge in storage, networking, and ZFS.

## Hardware Summary
- **Base System:** Dell OptiPlex 3020
- **CPU:** Intel Core i5-4590 @ 3.30GHz
- **RAM:** Upgraded from 4GB to 8GB DDR3
- **Storage:** Replaced 500GB HDD with 2TB SATA drive
- **Add-ons:** PCIe Wi-Fi & Bluetooth card
- **Boot Device:** 32GB USB drive for TrueNAS SCALE OS

## OS and Software
- Upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 11 (for hardware validation)
- Installed TrueNAS SCALE (25.04.1 Community Edition)
- Created SMB datasets: DocsShare, MediaShare, PhotoShare, jsanwo
- Static IP configured for persistent access
- Connected via CX File Explorer (Android) and Windows file explorer

## Current Status
The system is now running TrueNAS SCALE with shared datasets accessible over LAN. Remote access setup using Tailscale is pending and will be implemented in a follow-up project.
